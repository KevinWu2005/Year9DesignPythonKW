#Input
#What inputs are needed to calculate the volume of a cylinder?
name = input("What is your name: ")

radius = input("Input radius (cm): ")
radius = int(radius)

height = input("Input height (cm): ")
height = int(height)

#Process
#What formula is used to calculate the volume of a cylinder?
volume = 3.14 * radius * radius * height

#Output
#What is important about the output?
print("The volume is: ",volume)
